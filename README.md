# HiddenMarkovModel
This is an implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for EURUSD using the yfinance library. The model predicts two hidden states, one for when the price goes up and one for when the price goes down, based on the daily close price of EURUSD from January 1st, 2010 to March 1st, 2022.
